# Specification Quality Checklist: Lanes, an Isolated Git Checkout per Agent Terminal

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The three open questions (lane location, land strategy, agent-requested land/remove) were
  answered on 2026-10-23 with the suggested defaults.
- The spec names git, the `sonata` command, and the workspace file envelope. These are fixed
  product constraints from the constitution (system git, CLI, files as source of truth), not
  implementation choices, as in specs 003 and 004.
